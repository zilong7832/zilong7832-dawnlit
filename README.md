# Dawnlit

Your morning research signal: an explainable, editable daily feed for trustworthy
large language models. Dawnlit is intentionally local-first: it runs without
paid APIs, stores browser feedback locally, and adds cloud sync only when
configured.

## What works

- Fetches recent papers from `cs.LG`, `cs.AI`, `cs.CL`, `cs.CR`, and `stat.ML`.
- Widens the configured retrieval window over Saturday through Monday so quiet
  arXiv days can still surface papers that have never been recommended before.
- Uses extended backoff for temporary arXiv rate limits instead of failing after
  a short retry burst.
- Paginates the configured arXiv query and reports if its safety limit truncates results.
- Keeps a durable cross-source paper index and title fingerprint, so Today
  never repeats either an arXiv paper or its later conference version, and
  never fills an empty Today view from Weekly.
- If fewer than three recent arXiv papers qualify, fills only the missing slots
  from preference-matched NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACL, or EMNLP oral/spotlight
  papers, scanning 2026 first and then earlier years.
- Applies an LLM scope gate, with a small separate lane for transferable methods.
- Excludes multilingual, cross-lingual, and language-specific research such as
  Arabic-language evaluation before ranking.
- Scores each topic independently instead of using one seed-paper centroid.
- Separates relevance, evidence-quality, novelty, and freshness scores.
- Diversifies the final feed and limits non-LLM transfer papers.
- Produces structured abstract-grounded notes with an optional Workers AI upgrade.
- Supports Today, Weekly, Useful, simple feedback, topic editing, import/export,
  and adding new research directions.
- Archives papers marked “Not useful” or “Irrelevant” in the browser for seven
  days, then clears them automatically. Generated analyses remain cached.
- Ships a dependency-free Web Component for embedding a compact feed in Jekyll,
  Hugo, WordPress, React, or plain HTML sites.
- Includes an optional Cloudflare Worker + D1 API so browser changes affect the
  next scheduled build.
- Installs as a standalone iPhone app from Safari, with an offline app shell and
  cached access to the latest successfully loaded feed.
- Uses explicit Useful/Irrelevant feedback as positive and negative examples
  for an optional Semantic Scholar recommendation signal.
- Reports per-topic Useful/Irrelevant hit rates and derives bounded,
  non-compounding effective topic weights after enough feedback accumulates.

The checked-in feed contains the latest successful live build. A deterministic
fixture remains available for tests and offline UI development.

## Install on your iPhone

No App Store account or native build is required. After GitHub Pages deploys:

1. Open the deployed Dawnlit URL in Safari on your iPhone.
2. Tap **Install on iPhone** for the in-app instructions.
3. Tap Safari's **Share** button, choose **Add to Home Screen**, then tap **Add**.
4. Launch Dawnlit from its Home Screen icon.

The installed app opens without Safari chrome. Its Service Worker keeps the app
shell and the most recently loaded paper data available when the network is
temporarily unavailable. While online, it checks GitHub Pages first for the
latest app files and paper data. Reopening the app, returning to it after five
minutes, or refreshing it picks up a completed Pages deployment automatically.

## Install your own Dawnlit

The fastest path does not require a local development environment:

1. [Create a repository from the Dawnlit template](https://github.com/new?template_name=dawnlit&template_owner=hwyii).
2. Edit [`config/interests.txt`](config/interests.txt) in GitHub's web editor.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the source.
4. Open your deployed `/install.html` page to generate the embed code.

The hosted installer is also available at
[`https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/install.html`](https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/install.html).
Enter your GitHub username and repository name; it generates the correct
Web Component snippet and direct configuration links.

Saving `config/interests.txt` triggers an immediate feed rebuild. The scheduled
workflow also refreshes every day at 06:17 in `America/Detroit`.

## Why Dawnlit is different

Most paper products optimize one of three things: a large searchable corpus,
community popularity, or opaque similarity to saved papers. Dawnlit starts from
a different premise: a researcher should own and understand the filter.

- **Portable by design.** The full app, generated JSON, and embeddable widget
  can live on a personal website instead of behind a product account.
- **An explicit research profile.** Topics, weights, hard scope rules, and
  transferable-method exceptions are readable and version-controlled.
- **Simple feedback.** Each card has three research triage choices: useful, not
  useful, or irrelevant. On phones, papers form a swipeable previous/next deck;
  desktop keeps the full vertical list.
- **Explainable selection.** Relevance, evidence quality, novelty, and freshness
  remain separate, and every card shows why it matched.
- **A strict relevance floor.** A paper must clear the same scope, topic,
  language-focus, and relevance rules whether it came from arXiv or a
  conference fallback pool.
- **Local-first and open.** The baseline needs no paid AI API, and optional cloud
  services can be replaced without changing the feed format.

The current version is intentionally not a claim to beat mature products
everywhere. It uses transparent lexical/topic gates augmented
by optional Semantic Scholar feedback recommendations, rather than its own
production semantic index. Long-term ranking evaluation and a local scientific
embedding index remain the next technical milestones.

## Run locally

No Python packages are required.

```bash
python3 scripts/build_radar.py --no-ai
python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory public
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

The full application is at:

```text
http://localhost:8000/
```

The standalone widget demo is at:

```text
http://localhost:8000/widget-demo.html
```

To exercise the UI without calling arXiv:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_radar.py \
  --fixture tests/fixtures/arxiv_feed.xml \
  --now 2026-06-27T12:00:00+00:00 \
  --no-ai
```

Run the tests with:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Edit the research profile

For most users, the canonical interest list is
[`config/interests.txt`](config/interests.txt). It uses one line per direction:

```text
Mechanistic interpretability @ 0.8 :: sparse autoencoders, circuits, activation probing
```

The weight and comma-separated keywords are optional. Saving the file in
GitHub immediately rebuilds and deploys the feed.

[`config/profile.json`](config/profile.json) remains the advanced configuration
for retrieval scope, ranking weights, exclusions, and detailed topic rules.
When a name in `interests.txt` matches an advanced topic, Dawnlit retains those
rules and applies the simple weight and extra keywords on top.

The web Preferences page keeps interactive edits in browser storage by default.
Its **Edit interests on GitHub** button opens the durable simple configuration;
**Export profile** remains available for advanced edits.

The initial lanes are:

1. Efficient adversarial training for LLMs
2. LLM loss landscape
3. Data selection for LLMs
4. On-policy distillation
5. Trustworthy LLM
6. Statistical theory for LLMs

`phrases` are strong matches, `terms` are weaker matches, and `exclude` applies
inside a topic. Global LLM and transfer gating lives under `scope`.

## Embed it in any personal site

The compact feed is a native Web Component with isolated styles and no runtime
dependencies:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/widget/paper-radar-widget.js?v=1"
></script>

<paper-radar-widget
  feed="https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/data/papers.json"
  limit="3"
  theme="auto"
  heading="Recent papers"
  description="Selected around my current research interests."
  more-url="https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/"
></paper-radar-widget>
```

Supported attributes:

| Attribute      | Default                  | Purpose                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `feed`         | required                 | URL of a Dawnlit-compatible `papers.json` feed |
| `limit`        | `3`                      | Maximum number of cards                        |
| `theme`        | `auto`                   | `auto`, `light`, or `dark`                     |
| `density`      | `comfortable`            | Set `compact` to hide takeaways                |
| `heading`      | `Today’s research radar` | Widget title                                   |
| `description`  | built-in text            | Short introduction                             |
| `show-header`  | `true`                   | Set `false` for cards only                     |
| `show-summary` | `true`                   | Set `false` to hide takeaways                  |
| `show-score`   | `true`                   | Set `false` to hide score rings                |
| `more-url`     | unset                    | Link to the full standalone app                |
| `more-label`   | `Open full radar →`      | Footer link text                               |

The component emits `paper-radar-loaded`, `paper-radar-error`, and
`paper-radar-select` DOM events. JavaScript applications can also assign a feed
object directly through the element's `data` property.

Ready-to-copy integrations live in:

- [`integrations/html/embed.html`](integrations/html/embed.html)
- [`integrations/jekyll/_includes/paper-radar.liquid`](integrations/jekyll/_includes/paper-radar.liquid)

An iframe remains the broadest fallback for platforms that block custom
JavaScript:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/"
  title="Dawnlit"
  loading="lazy"
  style="width:100%;min-height:720px;border:0"
></iframe>
```

## AI morning briefs

The scheduled workflow sends only the final selected papers to Cloudflare
Workers AI. The default full-text model is `@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b`; if it is
unavailable or returns an invalid schema, Dawnlit retries with
`@cf/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-fp8`. Override these with the repository variables
`CLOUDFLARE_MODEL` and `CLOUDFLARE_FALLBACK_MODEL` when using direct
Cloudflare credentials. The bundled Worker proxy intentionally allows only the
two documented models.

The deployed personal Worker exposes an admin-token-protected AI proxy backed
by its native Workers AI binding. Therefore the scheduled build can reuse the
existing `RADAR_API_URL` and `RADAR_ADMIN_TOKEN`; separate Cloudflare AI secrets
in GitHub are optional direct-call fallbacks.

Each brief is grounded in the extracted paper text when available, or the title
and abstract as a fallback. Grounding and synthesis are produced first in a
canonical English fact layer; reader-facing Chinese is localized and validated
separately. A failed localization can therefore retry without downloading or
re-analyzing the PDF. The card turns the analysis into a dense three-line scan
covering the central finding, method, and strongest available evidence.

For each selected paper, the workflow also downloads up to the first 30 PDF
pages, extracts high-signal regions from the introduction, method, experiments,
results, limitations, and conclusion within an 18,000-character request budget,
and asks the model for a grounded deep dive. The **Deep dive** dialog includes:

- three complementary research signals;
- a detailed research question and thesis;
- the method pipeline and mechanism or theory;
- experimental design with named models, datasets, baselines, and metrics;
- results tied to concrete evidence;
- contributions, limitations, and open questions.

Successful analyses are cached by stable paper ID, paper update time, prompt version,
and schema version. An unchanged paper reuses its validated deep dive, while
stale weekly analyses are attempted gradually (three per build by default) so a
prompt upgrade or provider outage does not create an unbounded retry loop. Set
`AI_CACHE_REFRESH_LIMIT` to change the attempt limit and
`AI_CACHE_REFRESH_TIME_BUDGET_SECONDS` to bound background refresh time.

PDFs are capped at 25 MB. If full-text extraction fails, the analysis is
explicitly marked as abstract-based. Missing evidence must be stated rather
than invented, and unsupported detailed sections remain empty instead of being
filled with placeholders. If model inference or localization is unavailable,
Dawnlit marks the analysis pending, falls back to an extractive brief when
needed, and retries later without failing the scheduled feed deployment.

Add these repository secrets to use AI analysis:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

The default primary model is:

```text
@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b
```

## GitHub Pages deployment

1. Create a repository with **Use this template**.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Edit `config/interests.txt`; this triggers the first personalized build.
4. Run **Deploy Dawnlit** manually only if Pages was enabled after the first
   deployment attempt.

The resulting URL is:

```text
https://hwyii.github.io/dawnlit/
```

The update workflow runs every day at 06:17 in `America/Detroit`. It avoids the
start of the hour because scheduled GitHub workflows can be delayed under heavy
load. Changes to `config/**` or `scripts/**` also trigger an immediate update.

The arXiv query uses the configured lookback (and widens over arXiv's quiet
weekend). IDs already present in `public/data/seen.json` are excluded before
ranking. When fewer than `conference_fallback.minimum_daily` papers qualify,
the build reads its cached conference pool and fills only the missing slots.
The pool is refreshed from official ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS virtual Oral/Spotlight
pages and explicitly verified ACL-family schedule exports. It scans from the
current year (2026 today) back through 2022 and stores only candidates
that pass the repository preference rules. A failed conference source is
non-fatal: the last successful pool remains usable and source health is exposed
in `conference_source_status`. ACL/EMNLP accepted-paper lists are not treated as
oral lists; those venues enter the pool only when an official detailed schedule
explicitly identifies the presentation type. The start year advances
automatically, so the fallback does not need a yearly config edit.

## Optional preference and feedback sync

Static mode is enough to evaluate the ranking. For interactive sync:

```bash
cd worker
npm install
npx wrangler d1 create dawnlit
```

Put the returned database ID in `worker/wrangler.jsonc`, then:

```bash
npm run db:init:remote
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN
npm run deploy
```

Set the deployed Worker URL in:

1. `public/runtime-config.js` as `apiUrl`
2. GitHub repository variable `RADAR_API_URL`

Add the same admin token as the GitHub secret `RADAR_ADMIN_TOKEN`. In the
installed iPhone app, open **Preferences**, enter the token under **Data
ownership**, and tap **Save & sync**. The token stays on that device until you
tap **Forget token**; it is never committed to the public Pages site.

Initialize the remote profile:

```bash
curl -X PUT "$RADAR_API_URL/api/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RADAR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @config/profile.json
```

D1 retains profile versions, while feedback types remain simple:

- `useful` is a strong positive preference signal.
- `not_useful` is a weak negative signal; `irrelevant` is a strong negative
  signal. Both enter the seven-day browser archive.

The lexical preference model uses the most recent label for each paper and a
120-day half-life, so recent choices matter most without permanently locking
the feed into early feedback. Similar papers are reranked before the daily
relevance threshold and diversity pass.

Useful and Irrelevant labels also maintain a per-topic precision estimate. The
scheduled build attributes full credit to the paper's primary topic and reduced
credit to secondary matches, uses only the latest action for each paper, and
applies the same 120-day decay. Automatic tuning starts after four effective
samples. A Bayesian prior, confidence ramp, ±0.15 adjustment cap, and 0.2–1.0
weight bounds keep sparse feedback from causing abrupt preference changes.
Manual `weight` remains unchanged; every build derives a fresh
`effective_weight`, so the same labels never compound day after day. The
generated feed exposes `topic_feedback`, and Preferences shows Useful,
Irrelevant, hit rate, and the resulting effective weight for each topic.

Feedback is posted to D1 immediately. If the phone is offline or the Worker is
temporarily unavailable, the feedback remains in a local pending queue and is
retried when the app next starts, reconnects, or returns online. The next
scheduled GitHub Action reads that D1 feedback through `RADAR_API_URL`, uses it
in ranking, commits the new feed, and deploys it to Pages. The installed app
then fetches that feed the next time it becomes active.

On startup, each connected browser also reads the latest D1 feedback and
reconstructs Useful and seven-day hidden-paper state. Enter the same personal
API token once on the iPhone and desktop; the `CLOUD ✓` badge confirms that
device state is connected. Feed JSON is always fetched with cache bypass so
both devices see the same deployed recommendation batch.

Once at least one positive paper is synced, the scheduled build asks Semantic
Scholar for papers related to the latest positive and negative examples and
uses matching arXiv IDs as an extra ranking signal. This is enabled by default.
Set `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_RECOMMENDATIONS=0` in the workflow environment to disable
it, or add the optional `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` repository secret for an
authenticated request. A failed request is non-fatal and falls back to the
local ranking pipeline.

## Data and source use

The project stores descriptive metadata and generated notes, and links users to
official arXiv or conference pages. It does not redistribute PDFs. arXiv
requests use a paginated query with a three-second pause between pages. The
default scope is `cs.LG`, `cs.AI`, `cs.CL`, `cs.CR`, and `stat.ML`, with a
2,000-result safety limit. Conference pages are requested only when the daily
minimum is not met or the on-disk pool needs refresh. Generated feeds expose
arXiv truncation, conference supplement counts, minimum status, and per-source
conference health rather than silently presenting incomplete retrieval as
complete.

Thank you to arXiv for use of its open access interoperability.
